# SwiftUIPortfolio

SwiftUIPortfolio is a to-do app built with SwiftUI that allows users to create and manage projects, as well as items within each project. Each project can be opened and closed, and users can add a name and description to each project. Additionally, users can add items to each project, along with a name, description, and priority level (low, medium, high). Users can also mark items as done and set reminders for projects.

The app uses **Core Data** to store data, and includes unit and UI tests to ensure proper functionality. It also supports **Spotlight** search on iPhone, localization support for English and Turkish languages, and uses **SwiftLint** for coding rules and conventions. The project architecture is **MVVM**.

To run the app, simply clone the repository and open the project file in Xcode. Be sure to install any necessary dependencies before running the app.
